# Architecture

## Stack
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix)
- React Router
- TanStack Query
- Vitest

## Commands
- npm run dev
- npm run lint
- npm run typecheck
- npm run test
- npm run build

## Collaboration (Lovable ↔ GitHub)
- Lovable: create/iterate pages and layout quickly.
- GitHub PRs: refactors, shared components, data layer, CI/tests.
- Avoid editing the same route/component in parallel to reduce merge conflicts.
